• Performed data exploration and querying using SQL, extracting insights from large datasets (e.g., 85,000+ rows) including total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across countries and continents.

• Cleaned and reformatted raw COVID-19 data in Excel, splitting it into deaths and vaccinations tables, and imported it into SQL Server for efficient analysis.

• Developed 15-20 SQL queries of varying complexity, including aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, MAX), joins, CTEs, temp tables, and views, to showcase advanced data manipulation skills.

• Calculated key metrics such as death percentage (e.g., 2% global rate), infection rates by population, and rolling vaccination counts using window functions (e.g., PARTITION BY) in SQL.

• Planned a multi-tool approach, incorporating SQL for data processing, Tableau for visualization, and Python (Pandas) for additional cleaning and analysis in subsequent project phases.
